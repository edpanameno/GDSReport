# GDS Report

A .NET Console application that will be used to generate the GDS Report I run for the Client services department 
on the first day of each month. The motivation behind this application is to automate this for the deparment so that I can
do a basic query on the directory and have the results be sent to interested parties (me cc'ed) at 7:00 a.m. each 
morning on the first day of each month.
