# GDS Report

A .NET Console application that will be used to generate the GDS Report I run for Ben Mclarin and David Loor
on the first day of each month. The motivation behind this application is to automate this for them so that I can
do a basic query on the directory and have the results be sent to Ben and David (me cc'ed) at 7:00 a.m. each 
morning. This will free me up from doing other things without having to worry about doing this manual task.
